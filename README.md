# Relational-Network-Generator
The goal of this project is to ingest a list of trained relational statements and output a list of derived relational statements as well as generate a visualization of the output in graph form.
The script "relational permutation.R" now(03/24/2022) completes ingestion and outputs an edgelist for standalone use or network visualization in the form of a data table.  The input structure is limited.  Please read the code comments in the script for directions.
The script "Network graph visualizer.R" now(10/17/2021) ingests the edgelist table described above and outputs variants of network graphs depending on the filters and network options selected.  Please read the code comments in the script for directions.
